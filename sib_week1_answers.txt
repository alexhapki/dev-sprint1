#1 A route is a decorator that tells Flask what URL should trigger the app function. It's specify by using "route()".

#2 The only route we've specified is "/".

#3 The method that gets called is the "hello() function that we've defined.

#4 The code will look like the following:
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")				#To add the "/world" route, my initial thought was to put "world" after the "/" in the parantheses, but then I got an error 							when I tested the URL in my browser... Not quite sure how to correct add a route at "/world". 
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

#5 No, the ‘if __name__ == “__main__”:' will not be executed because it will only run of the script is executed from the Python interpreter.
